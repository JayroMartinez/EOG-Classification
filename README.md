# EOG-Classification
This project is an EOG signal classificator. The code is created to acquire the data using [OpenBCI Cyton biosignal acquisition board](https://docs.openbci.com/docs/02Cyton/CytonLanding "OpenBCI Cyton documentation"). The processing has been done with Raspberri Pi and MacOS.

The code uses [OpenBCI Python driver] (https://github.com/openbci-archive/OpenBCI_Python "OpenBCI Python repository on GitHub"), nowadays deprecated, to communicate with the board and acquire the signals.
